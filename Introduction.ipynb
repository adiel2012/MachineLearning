    "## Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience. Rather than being explicitly programmed for every task, a machine learning system learns from data to identify patterns and make decisions. Here are some key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Types of Learning**:\n",
    "   - **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means the input comes with corresponding correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is used on unlabeled data and must identify patterns and relationships within the data without any explicit instructions on what to look for.\n",
    "   - **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - **Classification**: Categorizing data into predefined classes, such as spam detection in emails.\n",
    "   - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values, such as house prices based on features like location and size.\n",
    "   \n",
    "      **Ordinal Regression**: also called ordinal classification, is a type of regression analysis used for predicting an ordinal variable, i.e. a variable whose value exists on an arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different values is significant. It can be considered an intermediate problem between regression and classification.\n",
    "   - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together, such as customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "   - **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products or content based on user behavior, such as movie recommendations on streaming platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Popular Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values.\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification problems.\n",
    "   - **Decision Trees**: For both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classification tasks.\n",
    "   - **Neural Networks**: For complex tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "   - **K-Means Clustering**: For grouping similar data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tools and Libraries**:\n",
    "   - **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: For building and training neural networks.\n",
    "   - **scikit-learn**: For a wide range of machine learning algorithms and utilities.\n",
    "   - **PyTorch**: For deep learning and neural network tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Process of Machine Learning**:\n",
    "   - **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data for the problem at hand.\n",
    "   - **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.\n",
    "   - **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "   - **Training**: Feeding the data into the algorithm to learn the patterns.\n",
    "   - **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.\n",
    "   - **Prediction**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.\n"

    "Problem Statement\n",
    "You receive numerous emails every day, and you want to filter out the spam emails automatically. A machine learning model can be trained to classify each incoming email as either spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection\n",
    "To build a spam email classifier, you need a dataset containing a large number of emails, each labeled as either spam or not spam. Such datasets are often available publicly for research purposes.\n",

    "Presence of specific keywords (e.g., \"free\", \"win\", \"money\").\n",
    "Frequency of certain words or phrases.\n",
    "Metadata such as the sender's email address.\n",
